## Abstract
As flying has become a more popular and commonplace means of transportation, the nature of the air travel experience began to change. People now face new problems of flight delays, leading to both mental and financial costs. This project combines two datasets on airline performance and weather events and builds several models to predict whether a flight will likely delay. The final model of random forest has reached a weighted F1-score of 0.67 with a discussion of model limitation and fairness in the end.
