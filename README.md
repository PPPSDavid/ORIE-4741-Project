## Project Description
Imagine a world where you can see the expected delay time of each flight when you are booking your next trip. You will never need to worry about cancelling plans and missing flights. It would be a game-changer for the aviation indutry.

In this project, we decided to investigate ways to predict US domestic flight delays with data avaliable when
1. the plane takes off
2. consumer buys plane ticket
and see if we can achieve accurate, interpretable results under both situations. We will use data from 2016-2020 as we believe the aviation industry is constantly evolving and old data may be outdated. We will also try to use both air traffic data and weather data to increase model expressiveness.

Our findings could help passengers and airlines to optimize their schedules and reduce the inconvinence of flight delays.
